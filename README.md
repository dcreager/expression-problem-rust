# Exploring the "expression problem" in Rust

Let's explore some interesting papers in Rust!

- ["Data types Ã  la carte"][data-types], Wouter Swierstra.
- ["Compositional data types"][compositional], Patrick Bahr, Tom Hvitved.

These papers all discuss the "expression problem", as described by [Phil
Wadler][expression-problem]:

> The goal is to define a data type by cases, where one can add new cases to the data type
and new functions over the data type, without recompiling existing code, and while retaining
static type safety.

Since these are FP papers, they all present solutions in Haskell.  I'd like to
explore the problem in Rust!  Unlike some other "lets implement some papers in
language X" explorations, my goal here is **_not_** to translate the Haskell
solutions into Rust; instead, I want to see what a *Rust solution* would look
like.  Partly that's because (at least as of right now) we don't have some of
the same building blocks available in Rust (e.g., functors, higher-kinded
types).  But my hunch is that we have *different* building blocks that let us
produce solutions with the same properties.  Let's see if that's true!
